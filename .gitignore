/target/

# The 'target' directory is where Cargo puts all compiled code,
# including executables, libraries, and intermediate object files.
# NEVER commit this directory.

# Build/Artifact directories for various platforms (in case of cross-compiling)
# You only need the main /target/ above, but these are good to include:
# target/debug/
# target/release/
# target/doc/
# target/tests/

# Rust's dependency manager (crates.io) cache
# This stores downloaded source code for dependencies.
# Uncomment if your Cargo home is inside the project directory (rare)
# .cargo/

# System and Editor Files
